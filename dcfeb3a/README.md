 DCFEB V3 firmware
================================================================
Official firmware for the Digital Cathode Front-End board (DCFEB)
production boards for the ME1/1 station of the Endcap MUon (EMU)
detector.
This repository contains the source code for the DCFEB project.
The ISE project file is dcfeb_f3a.xise.
This GIT project may have different branches compatible with
different ISE versions. The initial project contains IP cores
that are compatible with ISE 12.4.  The branch that is intended
to be used in production will be called Pro.
The ISE 14.6-trial branch has been merged back into the Pro
branch.  So now the IP cores in the Pro branch are compatible
with ISE 14.7.
